# History of group members' contribution

|      |            | **November 2019**                                                                            |

| _21_ | _Thursday_ | The group met to set up the work and decide who does what                                    |
|      |            |  **Matteo** created the GitHub repository and invited the other group members to collaborate |
| _23_ | _Saturday_ | The group started to do some brainstorming and discuss on how to structure the blockchain    |
|      |            |  **Francesca** called the other group members' attention on two interesting research papers representing a      good starting point to set the blockchain rationale and to figure out how to efficiently express it with codes     |                                                   
| _28_ | _Thursday_ | The group met for another brief brain storming session                                       |
|      |            |  **Edoardo** took notes and uploaded a Word document, containing also Petriconi's suggestions|

|      |            | **December 2019**                                                                            |

| _1_  | _Sunday_   |  **Matteo** and **Ning** started building the code for the BlockChain. They created the file `blockchain` which contains two classes: the class `Block` and the class `BlockChain`. The file `patient` contains a subclass `Patient` that inherits methods from the class `BlockChain`. |
| _2_  | _Monday_   |  **Matteo** completed the structure of the blockchain. The blockchain is built on 3 main files: `blockchain`, `event` and `patient`. |
| _3_  | _Tuesday_  |  **Edoardo** started testing some code about `web3` |
| _4_  | _Wednesday_|  **Matteo**, **Edoardo** and **He** met prof Petriconi to discuss with him about the model and explore other ideas |
| _5_  | _Thursday_ |  **Matteo** wrote a summary about what was discussed on Wednesday and uploaded it to git |
| _7_  | _Saturday_ |  **Matteo** and **Ning** created a new class, `Doctor` and updated some functions in the BlockChain code |
| _8_  | _Sunday_   |  **Edoardo** and **He** created a new implementation of a unique standard blockchain |
|      |            |  **Matteo** completed the structure of the first implementation of the blockchain |
| _8_  | _Sunday_   |  **Francesca** did some research on how `IOTA` works, looked for a way to implement it in Python and detected some useful packages and relevant documentation for this purpose. |
| _9_  | _Monday_   |  **Francesca** did further research on the concept of secrecy, distinguishing between `backward` and `forward secrecy` in cryptography. She found some useful examples of algorithms allowing for secrecy achievement. |
|      |            |  **Matteo** completed the code of the first implementation of the BlockChain and created a Jupyter Notebook that shows a simulation of this technology |
|      |            |  **Edoardo** and **Francesca** continued implementation of the standard blockchain and uploaded a document showing how this new blockchain works |  
| _10_ | _Tuesday_  |  **Edoardo** implemented different kinds of transactions in the standard blockchain |
| _11_ | _Wednesday_|  **Francesca** looked for useful papers on how blockchains can improve bureaucracy-related issues in the healthcare system so as to verify if the blockchain prototype is efficiently addressing these needs. |
| _12_ | _Thursday_ |  **Francesca** did some more research and started contextualising the blockchain prototype by writing down what she found. |
| _13_ | _Friday_   | The group met professor Petriconi to discuss about the project |
|      |            |  **Edoardo** finished merging both implementations |
| _14_ | _Saturday_ |  **Edoardo** wrote a report of the final blockchain to update the other team members |
| _15_ | _Monday_   | The whole group wrote a final paper |
