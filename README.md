# HealthcareBlockchain
Prototype of a Blockchain applied to the healthcare sector.

You can find the first version of the blockchain in the [`src`](https://github.com/MatteoFacchetti/HealthcareBlockchain/tree/master/src) folder, while the final version is inside the [`unique_blockchain`](https://github.com/MatteoFacchetti/HealthcareBlockchain/tree/master/unique_blockchain) folder.

The simulations of both versions can be found inside the [`notebooks`](https://github.com/MatteoFacchetti/HealthcareBlockchain/tree/master/notebooks) folder. These show how both implementations work in practice, even if the final implementation basically replaces the first one.

Inside the [`docs`](https://github.com/MatteoFacchetti/HealthcareBlockchain/tree/master/docs) folder, it is also possible to find a short paper, called [HealthCare_BlockChain.pdf](https://github.com/MatteoFacchetti/HealthcareBlockchain/blob/master/docs/HealthCare_BlockChain.pdf). We wrote this paper in order to explain what are the current problems in the health care sector and how this technology can solve them and make a positive impact on society.
