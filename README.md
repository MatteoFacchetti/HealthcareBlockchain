# HealthcareBlockchain
Prototype of a Blockchain applied to the healthcare sector.

You can find the first version of the blockchain in the `src` folder, while the final version is inside the `unique_blockchain` folder.

The simulations of both versions can be found inside the `src/notebooks` folder. These show how both implementations work in practice.

Finally, we have a folder called `docs` used internally to share documents and sources for the project development. Inside this folder, it is also possible to find a [report, called HealthCare_BlockChain.pdf](https://github.com/MatteoFacchetti/HealthcareBlockchain/blob/master/docs/HealthCare_BlockChain.pdf). We wrote that report in order to explain what are the current problems in the health care sector and how such technology can solve them and make a positive impact on society.
